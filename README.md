# Image Processing Filters Project

This project explores the application of various image processing filters using Python. The goal is to demonstrate and analyze the effects of basic and advanced filters on images, providing insights into their use cases and potential applications in different domains such as computer vision and image enhancement.

## Contents

1. **Introduction**
   - Overview of image processing and its importance.
   - Objectives of the project.

2. **Techniques Covered**
   - Basic image filters:
     - Gaussian Blur
     - Median Filtering
     - Edge Detection (e.g., Sobel, Canny)
   - Advanced filters:
     - Laplacian Filtering
     - High-Pass Filtering
     - Custom Convolution Kernels

3. **Implementation Details**
   - Reading and preprocessing images.
   - Applying different filters using libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy.
   - Visualizing the results of each filter.

4. **Data**
   - The project uses sample images provided in the repository. Users can also supply their own images to test the filters.

5. **How to Use**
   - Clone the repository or download the notebook file (`Image_Processing_Filters.ipynb`).
   - Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:
     - `numpy`
     - `opencv-python`
     - `matplotlib`
   - Place the desired images in the `images/` directory or specify their paths in the notebook.
   - Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Run the cells sequentially to apply and visualize the filters.

6. **Key Insights**
   - Each filter's effect on different types of images.
   - Performance comparison between basic and advanced filtering techniques.
   - Practical applications of specific filters.

7. **Conclusion and Recommendations**
   - Summary of findings and observations.
   - Suggestions for extending the project, such as integrating the filters into real-time applications or exploring machine learning-based filtering techniques.
